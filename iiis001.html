                                <p>Have you ever wondered why businesses develop information systems in the first place,
                                    or how they know when it is the time to replace an old information system? <br><br>
                                    Systems development project may be initiated for a number of reasons. Can you think
                                    of some of those reasons?</p>
                                <h3>Initiating System Development</h3>
                                <p>System development projects maybe initiated for a number of reasons, including: <br>
                                    - problems with existing system <br>
                                    - increasing competition <br>
                                    - to make effective use of technologies <br>
                                    - organisational growth <br>
                                    - change in market or external environment</p>
                                <h3>System development</h3>
                                <p>System development is the activity of creating or modifying existing business
                                    systems. <br>
                                    Each year, billions of dollars are spent on the acquisition of information systems.
                                    <br>
                                    Effective system development requires a team effort and it starts with careful
                                    planning.
                                </p>
                                <h2>"System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)"</h2>
                                <p>SDLC is a traditional method used by many system analyst to help them in the
                                    development of a system. <br>
                                    - This methodology gives a step-by-step guide of what must be done in the process of
                                    developing a large system. The main idea of this is help system analyst to keep
                                    track of their progress, carefully planning and ensuring things are done in order.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Investigation</h3>
                                <p>In this stage, potential problems and opportunities are identified.</p>
                                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                                <p>This stage involves the study of existing systems and work processes to identify
                                    strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.</p>
                                <h3>Design</h3>
                                <p>The purpose of system design is to answer the question "How will the information
                                    system solve a problem?" <br>
                                    - Logical Design represents the logic nature of a system - what talks the system is
                                    doing. <br>
                                    - Physical design tells us where, how, and by whom a system's process are
                                    accomplished.</p>
                                <h3>Implementation</h3>
                                <p>System implementation consists of creating and acquiring the various system
                                    components and integrating the new or modified system into operation.</p>
                                <p>This phase includes: <br>
                                    - coding <br>
                                    - testing &amp; debugging <br>
                                    - training <br>
                                    - hardware acquisition and installation <br>
                                    - site and data preparation <br>
                                    - documentation</p>
                                <h3>Maintenance</h3>
                                <p>Maintenance involves checking, changing, modifying the system to make it more useful
                                    to achieve user and organisational goals.</p>

                                    many departments, etcetera. <br>
                                    - When many people are involved with the system. <br>
                                    - When the analyst wants to: <br>
                                    + get general opinion <br>
                                    + verify information regarding interview responses <br>
                                    + further gain more information from more respondents after obtaining the interview
                                    responses. <br>
                                    + the respondents have shorter time to answer. <br>
                                    - The survey can be done online and respondents can answer the questions
                                    anonymously, allow more flexibility in terms of time/place to answer the questions.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
                                <p>- Return rate can be poor <br>
                                    - To prepare a good survey analyst needs to know as much about the topic as the user
                                    (and therefore clear survey purpose is need) <br>
                                    - Can be boring for the respondents if there are many numbers of questions and/or
                                    the long question contents. <br>
                                    - If paper based survey is conducted, may get incomplete answers (Incomplete answers
                                    cannot be used for further analysis). <br>
                                    - Need follow-up process for online survey </p>
                                <h2>"Observation"</h2>
                                <p>Observing workers at selected times to see how data are handled and what information
                                    people need to do their jobs, what are the difficulties in performing the jobs.</p>
                                <h3>When to use</h3>
                                <p> - When the analyst needs to get "the big picture". <br>
                                    - Where a system is particularly complex. <br>
                                    - Where the respondents have given conflicting information in the interview. <br>
                                    - When the respondents are unable to articulate/explain. <br>
                                    - To gain insight information of what exactly happening in the workplace.</p>
                                <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                                <p>- Users don't get input into your thoughts - sometimes they feel frustrated. <br>
                                    - Hawthorn effect - users don't act as they normally would. <br>
                                    - Takes a lot of time. <br>
                                    - Not easy to gain access to the workplace. <br>
                                    - Users may resent the intrusion (e.g privacy issues) <br>
                                    - Written report is needed during the observation (if the record isn't permitted)
                                </p>
                                <h2>"Form and report gathering"</h2>
                                <p>It is essential in each system to gather all of the forms currently in use. <br><br>
                                    This allows a cross check for the data requirements and a useful starting block for
                                    forms design and testing.</p>

                                    - Give a clear and consistent description of what the system should do. <br>

                                    + Use cases are requirements - but not all of the requirements. <br>
                                    + Use cases are not easy to draw and write - but there are techniques to make your

                                    - <strong>Actors:</strong> entities that the system interacts with. <br>
                                    - <strong>Use cases:</strong> services that the system performs. <br>
