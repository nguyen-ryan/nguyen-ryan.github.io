                                <p>Have you ever wondered why businesses develop information systems in the first place,
                                    or how they know when it is the time to replace an old information system? <br><br>
                                    Systems development project may be initiated for a number of reasons. Can you think
                                    of some of those reasons?</p>
                                <h3>Initiating System Development</h3>
                                <p>System development projects maybe initiated for a number of reasons, including: <br>
                                    - problems with existing system <br>
                                    - increasing competition <br>
                                    - to make effective use of technologies <br>
                                    - organisational growth <br>
                                    - change in market or external environment</p>
                                <h3>System development</h3>
                                <p>System development is the activity of creating or modifying existing business
                                    systems. <br>
                                    Each year, billions of dollarsare spent on the acquisition of information systems.
                                    <br>
                                    Effective system development requires a team effort and it starts with careful
                                    planning.
                                </p>
                                <h2>"System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)"</h2>
                                <p>SDLC is a traditional method used by many system analyst to help them in the
                                    development of a system. <br>
                                    - This methodology gives a step-by-step guide of what must be done in the process of
                                    developing a large system. The main idea of this is help system analyst to keep
                                    track of their progress, carefully planning and ensuring things are done in order.
                                </p>
                                <h3>The SDLC</h3>

                                <h3>Investigation</h3>
                                <p>In this stage, potential problems and opportunities are identified.</p>
                                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                                <p>This stage involves the study of existing systems and work processes to identify
                                    strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.</p>
                                <h3>Design</h3>
                                <p>The purpose of system design is to answer the question "How will the information
                                    system solve a problem?" <br>
                                    - Logical Design represents the logic nature of a system - what talks the system is
                                    doing. <br>
                                    - Physiscal design tells us where, how, and by whom a system's process are
                                    accomplished.</p>
                                <h3>Implementation</h3>
                                <p>System implementation consists of creating and acquiring the various system
                                    components and integrating the new or modified system into operation.</p>
                                <p>This phase includes: <br>
                                    - coding <br>
                                    - testing &amp; debugging <br>
                                    - training <br>
                                    - hardware acquisition and installation <br>
                                    - site and data preparation <br>
                                    - documentaion</p>
                                <h3>Maintenance</h3>
                                <p>Maintenance involves checking, changing, modifying the system to make it more useful
                                    to achieve user and organisational goals.</p>
